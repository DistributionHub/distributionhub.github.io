## Developer's Note

When selecting mirror servers for downloading distributions, preference has been given to European servers, with a particular focus on German mirrors when available. This choice is based on the goal of providing stable and reliable download speeds for users, especially those within Europe. By using these well-maintained and widely trusted mirrors, we aim to enhance the overall user experience, ensuring that downloads are both fast and efficient.
